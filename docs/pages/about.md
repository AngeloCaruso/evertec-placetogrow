## Description

This project has been developed as part of the Evertec PHP Bootcamp 2024, aimed at showcasing advanced PHP and Laravel skills. The application is structured into three main modules, each designed to address specific functionalities and user needs. The core focus of this development is the microsites administration module, which provides robust and flexible tools for managing multiple microsites efficiently.

Upon accessing the application, users will be greeted with an intuitive interface that simplifies navigation and enhances the user experience. The main modules include:

1. **User Management Module**: This module allows administrators to create, update, and delete user accounts. It also includes features for assigning roles and permissions, ensuring that each user has appropriate access levels.

2. **Role Management Module**: This module is designed to manage user roles and permissions within the application. Administrators can define new roles, modify existing ones, and assign specific permissions to each role. This ensures a granular level of control over what each user can access and perform within the application.

3. **Microsites Administration Module**: The centerpiece of this application, this module provides comprehensive tools for managing microsites. Users can create new microsites, customize their appearance, and configure settings to meet specific needs. This module also includes analytics and reporting features to track the performance and engagement of each microsite.
